MonkeyBlog

This is a simple blog application built with python and Flask framework. As a visitor, the user can view blog posts and use full text search to find posts with certain key words. As an administrator, the user can add new entries, edit and delete them, add tags to them and edit or delete tags. Editing or deleting tags affects all blog entries those tags are attached to. There's also a pagination functionality that takes place when more than 5 blog entries exist.
